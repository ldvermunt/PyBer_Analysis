# PyBer_Analysis.

## Overview
  This analysis was run in order to gain a better understanding of the performance of a fictional ride share company "PyBer".  The analysis and visualizations produced  should help Pyber improve access to ridesharing services as well as make decisions regarding where to concentrate recources such as drivers.
  
## Results
  It was discoverd that PyBer was involved in urban, suburban, and rural communities. Using the data we were able to show that while urban routes heavily outnumbered rural ones and utilized more drivers, but tended to have a lower average fare cost.

  Despite the higher per fare revenue realized in the urban and suburban areas,  the sheer weight of their business in the urban sectors produced significantly more fares for the company.

  The data shows heavy weight in resources and higher return geared towards populated areas.
  
## Summary
  Three recomendations for the company based on this analysis would be:
    
  1. Gathering data on how many routes individual drivers are taking would give a better understanding if Urban areas are being over staffed.  While the urban fare and ride percentaes sit at 63% and 68% of the total share, driver counts are closer to 81% of the total.  Driver recruitment could be slowed and those resources better applied elsewhere.
  2. Rural area driver counts may be hampering the share of revenue from these areas.  Only 2.6% of the companies drivers are serving such areas, despite making 6.8% of the fares.  Are customers waiting for rides too long in these areas?
  3. There is a significant decline in fares for suburban and to a greater extent urban cities in April.  Why was this?  The trend was corrected in short order, but more data on this anomaly could prevent future declines.  ![PyBer_fare_summary](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111530580/191796933-f31aac07-c399-433f-8caf-b7562f2de36e.png)
